Tasks
Build a small full stack application that includes the following core capabilities:

1. Document Creation and Editing
Users should be able to:

Create a new document
Rename a document
Edit document content in a browser
Save and reopen documents
The editing experience should support basic rich-text formatting such as:

Bold
Italic
Underline
Headings or text size variation
Bulleted or numbered lists
You do not need to match Google Docs exactly, but the editing flow should feel usable and coherent.

2. File Upload
Allow a user to upload at least one file into the product workflow. You may choose the exact behavior, but it should be product-relevant. Examples include:

Uploading a .txt, .md, or .docx file and turning it into a new editable document
Uploading an attachment that is associated with a document
Importing content from a file into an existing draft
If you limit supported file types, state that clearly in the UI and README.

3. Sharing
Implement a simple sharing model so that one user can share a document with another. This does not need to be enterprise-grade access control, but it should demonstrate clear intent and working logic.

At minimum, include:

A document owner
A way to grant another user access
A visible distinction between owned and shared documents
You may simulate users with seeded accounts, mocked auth, or a lightweight login flow if that keeps the scope reasonable.

4. Persistence
Persist documents and sharing data so that:

Documents remain available after refresh
Formatting or structure is preserved in a reasonable way
Shared access behavior can be demonstrated
You may use any practical storage approach for this scope, including SQLite, Postgres, Supabase, or a local file-based store if well documented.

5. Product and Engineering Quality
Include enough engineering quality to show how you work in practice. At minimum, include:

Clear setup and run instructions
A working deployment reviewers can access via your preferred deployment path
Basic validation and error handling
At least one meaningful automated test
A short architecture note explaining what you prioritized and why
AI-Native Workflow Note
Because this is an AI-forward role, include a short note explaining:

Which AI tools you used
Where AI materially sped up your work
What AI-generated output you changed or rejected
How you verified correctness, UX quality, and implementation reliability
We are evaluating practical AI usage, not volume of AI usage.
